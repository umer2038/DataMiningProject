In this project, we developed an intelligent system to predict future electricity demand using advanced data mining techniques. The goal was to help utility providers make smarter decisions around grid management, power generation, and resource allocation by analyzing historical load data and external influencing factors such as weather conditions, time patterns, and seasonality.

We explored multiple forecasting models including decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks. After extensive preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, we found that hybrid ensemble techniques provided the best balance between accuracy and generalization.

We also implemented visual dashboards to track forecasting accuracy and to make the results easily interpretable for non-technical stakeholders.

This project not only helped us understand the real-world impact of predictive modeling in the energy sector but also gave us hands-on experience in designing end-to-end data-driven systems, from raw data to actionable insights.
